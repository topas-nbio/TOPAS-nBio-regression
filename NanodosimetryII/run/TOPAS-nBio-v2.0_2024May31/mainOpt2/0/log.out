TOPAS is in MT mode, setting number of threads to: 1

TOPAS set the tolerances based on the World size to:
      Surface tolerance = 1e-10 nm, and radial tolerance = 1e-10 nm.
Checking overlaps for volume Target (G4Tubs) ... OK! 

Checking for Unused Components.
These are Components that were never built even though they were at least
partially defined in some parameters. This is not necessarily an error.
It may be an intentional choice to have these Component definitions handy for later use.
To turn off this check, set Ge/CheckForUnusedComponents to False
  No unused components were found.

Visualization verbosity changed to quiet (0)
